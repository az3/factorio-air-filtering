# Air Filtering Mod for Factorio

This mod adds air filtering machines to reduce pollution in your factory. The machines consume unused air filters to clean the surrounding area of pollution.

## Features

- **Three tiers of air filtering machines**: Basic, MK2, and MK3 with increasing efficiency
- **Circuit Network Integration**: All machines can connect to the circuit network
  - Control machines via circuit conditions (enable/disable)
  - Monitor machine contents through the circuit network
  - Integrate with your automated factory systems
- **Pollution Reduction**: Machines actively remove pollution from the surrounding area
- **Space-Age Compatibility**: Works with the Space Age expansion, including spore cleaning

## Usage

Place air filter machines near polluted areas and supply them with unused air filters. Higher tier machines are more efficient but consume more power.

With circuit network connectivity, you can:
- Enable/disable machines based on pollution levels
- Monitor filter consumption and machine status
- Automate your air filtering operations

## Recipes

- **Unused Air Filters**: Crafted from coal, plastic bars, and steel plates
- **Air Filter Machine**: Requires assembling machine 2, electronic circuits, and steel plates
